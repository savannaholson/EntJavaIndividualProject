# Book Rating System
#### Savannah Olson

##Problem Statement
Over my winter break I did a lot of reading, and found myself wanting to have a program of some kind to keep track of what books I had read, how I would rate the book and when I last read it. This would help me to re-visit books that I really enjoyed but can't remember the name of. I would also like to create some kind of reccomendation list.
